The plane defined by (x-a)*n =0 is:
  a = (500, 200, 3)
  n = (1,2,3)
The eye e is:
  e = (800, 50, 123)
The coordinates in the plane x = p0 + u*w1 + v*w2 is:
 (where p0 is the origin, preferraby the projection of the center of the cube in first frame, w1 and w2 are 2 perpendicular vertices in the plane)
  p0 = (14.3498,0.896861,2.20628)
  w1 = (1,0,0)
  w2 = (0,0,-1)
